# Create Pull Request Skill

Commits your changes and creates a pull request for code review. This skill prepares your work for review WITHOUT marking the Jira ticket as "Done" - that happens after the PR is merged.

## Usage

```
/05-create-pr <JIRA-KEY> "<summary>"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage
/05-create-pr SOC-5 "Implemented Streamlit review interface"

# With more detail
/05-create-pr SOC-8 "Added LinkedIn API integration with OAuth2 flow and post scheduling"
```

## What It Does

### 1. Git Status Check

- Runs `git status` to see what files changed
- Runs `git diff` to review the actual changes
- Verifies there are changes to commit

### 2. Jira Update

- Fetches the current Jira issue details using the Atlassian MCP Server
- Adds a comprehensive comment with:
  - Work summary and file changes
  - Scope changes (if any) with rationales
  - Follow-up work identified
  - Known limitations
  - Metrics (LOC, test coverage, architectural decisions)
- **Transitions ticket to "In Review"** (if available) or keeps in "In Progress"
- Does NOT transition to "Done" - that happens after PR merge

### 3. Git Commit

- Generates a commit message following the format:

  ```
  [JIRA-KEY] Brief description

  Detailed changes:
  - Change 1
  - Change 2
  - Change 3

  Jira: https://[site].atlassian.net/browse/JIRA-KEY
  ```

- Commits all staged and unstaged changes
- Includes the Jira ticket link in the commit

### 4. Git Push

- Pushes the commit to the remote repository
- Reports the result

### 5. Create Pull Request

- Creates PR using GitHub MCP with:
  - Title from Jira ticket
  - Summary of changes from git log
  - Test plan section
  - Link to Jira ticket
- Links PR to Jira as remote issue link
- Posts PR link to Jira comments

## Prerequisites

- Jira MCP server configured in [.mcp.json](../.mcp.json)
- GitHub MCP server configured in [.mcp.json](../.mcp.json)
- Git repository initialized
- Git remote configured
- Working directory must have changes to commit

## Arguments

| Argument   | Required | Description                             | Example            |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `jira_key` | Yes      | The Jira issue key (e.g., SOC-5)        | `SOC-5`            |
| `summary`  | Yes      | Brief description of the work completed | `"Implemented UI"` |

## Jira Status Transition Logic

The skill automatically determines the appropriate Jira transition:

- If "In Review" status exists → transitions to "In Review"
- Otherwise → keeps ticket in "In Progress"
- **Never** transitions to "Done" (that's for `/07-complete-task` after PR merge)

## Error Handling

The skill will:

- Stop if there are no changes to commit
- Report if Jira ticket doesn't exist
- Report if git push fails
- Report if PR creation fails
- Provide clear error messages at each step

## Enhanced Jira Comment Format

The skill creates a comprehensive Jira comment with the following sections:

```markdown
## 🔍 Work Summary for Code Review

[High-level summary of work completed]

### What Was Delivered

- [Key deliverable 1]
- [Key deliverable 2]
- [Key deliverable 3]

### Technical Implementation

[Brief description of approach]

## 📊 Scope Changes

[This section is optional - only included if there were scope changes]

✅ **Within Ticket Scope:**

- Task A: Completed as specified
- Task B: Completed with minor enhancement

⚠️ **Beyond Ticket Scope (Added):**

- Feature X: Brief rationale for addition
- Enhancement Y: Brief rationale for addition

🚫 **Deferred from Ticket:**

- Task Z: Reason for deferral

[If no scope changes]: "No scope changes - implemented exactly as specified in ticket."

## 🔄 Follow-up Work Identified

[Optional - only if follow-up work was discovered]

- [Item 1]: Suggested future ticket
- [Item 2]: Suggested future ticket

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

[Optional - only if there are known limitations]

- [Limitation 1]: Description
- [Limitation 2]: Description

## 📈 Metrics

- Lines of code: +XXX / -YYY
- Test coverage: XX tests, YY% coverage
- Files changed: N files created, M files modified
- Architectural decisions: N documented in code
- [Other relevant metrics]

## Files Changed

- file1.py: [Brief description]
- file2.py: [Brief description]

## 🔗 Pull Request

Created PR for code review: [PR Link]
```

## Pull Request Template

The skill generates a PR description with:

```markdown
## Summary

[Brief description of changes from git log]

## Changes

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]

## Test Plan

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Edge cases covered

## Jira Ticket

[JIRA-KEY]: [Ticket Title]
Link: https://[site].atlassian.net/browse/JIRA-KEY

## Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Comments added for complex logic
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or breaking changes documented)
```

## What Happens Next

After this skill completes:

1. Your changes are committed and pushed
2. A PR is created and linked to Jira
3. Jira ticket is in "In Review" status
4. **Next step**: Run `/06-pr-review` to conduct automated code review and implement improvements
5. **Final step**: Run `/07-complete-task` to merge the PR and mark Jira as "Done"

## Notes

- Always review changes with `git status` and `git diff` before running
- The skill adds a co-authored-by line for Claude in commits
- Jira comments include comprehensive completion details for traceability
- Scope changes are highlighted with clear rationales
- The commit message includes a link back to the Jira ticket
- Architectural decisions are counted and referenced
- **This skill does NOT close the Jira ticket** - that happens after PR merge in `/07-complete-task`

## Integration with Workflow

### Complete SDLC Workflow:

```bash
1. /02-start-task SOC-15              # Start work, Jira → "In Progress"
2. /03-dev-execute SOC-15             # Implement feature
3. /04-reconcile-work SOC-15          # Optional: Verify alignment
4. /05-create-pr SOC-15 "Done"        # Commit, push, create PR, Jira → "In Review"
5. /06-pr-review                      # Automated code review and improvements
6. /07-complete-task                  # Merge PR, Jira → "Done"
```

This ensures proper separation of:

- **Development** (02-03): Writing code
- **Quality Check** (04): Verifying requirements
- **Code Review** (05-06): PR creation and review
- **Deployment** (07): Merging and closing

## Difference from Old `/05-complete-task`

### Old Behavior (Incorrect):

```
/05-complete-task → Commit → Push → Jira → "Done" ✅
/06-pr-workflow → Create PR (ticket already closed!) ❌
```

### New Behavior (Correct):

```
/05-create-pr → Commit → Push → Create PR → Jira → "In Review" 🔍
/06-pr-review → Review and improve code 🔧
/07-complete-task → Merge PR → Jira → "Done" ✅
```

This follows standard SDLC where tickets are only marked "Done" **after** the PR is merged, not before.
